              In simple terms, Technology can be defined as the process that can
              be used to solve all the problms and also storing important
              knowledge or data using computers.Technology, our new present and
              future, is making human lives easire and more convinent.We are all
              surrounded ny technologie from all the sides, From wakeing up in
              the morning ,till we sleep, in some way or the othe rwe need
              technologires in our life. The entire civilization has become
              reliant on the modern technology it employs.Life and business
              would come to halt without the technology.It has increased
              productivity across all fields of work. For every activity, we
              need technology, and that makes it an integral part our life ,but
              the main drwback of it is that people are being lazy and relying
              too much on the technology and not being active enough to
              contrubute much to the world and the surrounding .Though
              technology has its owm pros and cons it depends on us how to use
              it .
